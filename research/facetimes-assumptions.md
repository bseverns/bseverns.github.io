# Human-Buffer — Assumption Ledger (formerly faceTimes)

What I’m assuming, why it matters, how I mitigate.

> **Canonical source:** `TODO: add GitHub URL to Human-Buffer/ASSUMPTIONS.md`
> **Last synced:** `TODO: YYYY-MM-DD`

## Ledger (excerpt)
| ID | Assumption | Risk | Mitigation | Evidence/Link |
|----|------------|------|------------|---------------|
| A-01 | On-device detection only | Drift toward network calls | Lock builds; lint CI for net calls | `TODO: link test` |
| A-02 | Delete by default | Accidental retention | Confirm UI + timeout purge | `TODO: link UI test` |
| A-03 | No identification | Feature creep | Scope statement in README | `TODO: link README` |

`TODO: Embed full ledger once uploaded.`

## Logic diagrams
`TODO: Add diagrams (mermaid or PNG)`  

## Teaching sketch
- Students audit assumptions
- Convert one mitigation into a test
- Reflect on where ethics meet engineering
