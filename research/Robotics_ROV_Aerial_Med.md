### 4.1 ROV / Underwater Capture (student-built)
ROV build as capture/installation support adjacent to portfolio works.
- **Artifacts to (re)gather**
  - [ ] Build photos
  - [ ] Tether/camera notes
  - [ ] Placement plan alongside sampler images
- **Next micro-step**: One paragraph on how ROV footage converses with images.

### 4.2 FPV Micro-Whoop Build/Fly Track
Solder → assembly → simulator (Velocidrone) → flight; safety & crash choreography.
- **Artifacts to (re)gather**
  - [ ] Parts list v1
  - [ ] Build photos
  - [ ] Simulator lesson captures
- **Next micro-step**: Lock a baseline parts list with prices.

### 4.3 Arduino Driving-Base Bots
IO & voltage control foundations; vibe/expressivity.
- **Artifacts to (re)gather**
  - [ ] Demo videos of “personality moves”
  - [ ] Wiring one-pagers
- **Next micro-step**: Record a single 30-sec demo of a “mood routine.”
