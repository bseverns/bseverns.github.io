# Privacy & Ethics

We treat sensing as an **agreement**, not a default. This page mirrors the canonical document in the code repositories and is kept in sync at review milestones.

> **Canonical source:** `TODO: add GitHub URL to PRIVACY_ETHICS.md`  
> **Last synced:** `TODO: YYYY-MM-DD`

## Principles (snapshot)
- Opt-in by design
- Data minimization, local computation first
- Transparent interfaces (“Show”, “Delete”, “Save with intent”)
- Classroom/public signage and accessible language
- Logs, assumption ledgers, and reproducible mitigation steps
