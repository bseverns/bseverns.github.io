# MN42 — Latency Characterization Lab

Latency is a feeling before it is a number; I measure so students can reason about mappings, not mythologize them.

## Method (replicable)
- Loopback rig: `TODO: describe interface + cabling`
- Buffer sizes & sample rates: `TODO: enumerate`
- Trial counts & stats: `TODO: specify`
- Script(s): `TODO: link`

## Results (snapshot)
![Round-trip latency plots — baseline vs tuned](/assets/images/mn42-latency-baseline.png "Round-trip latency plots — baseline vs tuned")
*Alt:* Round-trip latency plots showing baseline and tuned configurations.  
`TODO: replace with real chart`

### Interpretation (2–3 sentences per plot)
- `TODO: Add notes`

## Notes for class
- Prompts, pitfalls, follow-ups
- How to reproduce on student machines
