    img_src: /assets/images/cds/faceTimes-consent.svg
    img_alt: faceTimes consent screen showing detection-only, opt-in language and a visible delete-now action
    abstract: On-device, detection-only pipeline with explicit opt-in and delete-now controls. No identification, no network calls, and no storage without consent. Interface copy foregrounds agency before computation; documentation (README, PRIVACY/ETHICS, assumption ledger) is treated as research output.
    abstract_locked: true
    aligns: ["digital literacy","justice/representation","civic engagement","DIY"]
    methods:
      - Classroom demo & public kiosk contexts
      - Detection overlay with visible status + erase
      - System: webcam → local detector → ephemeral buffer → user action
    outcomes:
      - Deployed in 1 kiosk (TBD)
      - Used by ~24 students (TBD)
      - 3 critique sessions (TBD)
      - 1 iteration logged (TBD)
    teach:
      goal: Practice consent-forward capture as digital literacy
      lab60: Implement detection-only pipeline; test erase-now; reflect on affordances
      assess: Process log + assumption ledger + 2-min demo

    abstract: Two short studies—rural pursuit (DS200412) and wheel-mounted POV (DS200801)—probing surveillance logics, attention, and embodied capture toward a larger film project. Tests “pursuit grammar” and mechanical vision’s entrainment.

    abstract: >-
      Paired interventions that make media power felt: a “Spectacle” action-lecture moves
      critique into public space; a structured “Media Fast” maps sensory shifts and agency
      before reflective media making. Designed as public method; prompts and reflections are
      the artifacts.
