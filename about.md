## Bio
Ben Severns is an interdisciplinary artist whose studio work is centered around the need for some way out of the theoretically evitable cycle of Spectacular distraction and self-involvement that permeates contemporary life.

Shifting media as it suits the project, his work has been exhibited throughout the United States, including at Boston University, the Institute of Contemporary Art at the Maine College of Art, the Science Museum of Minnesota, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, Public Functionary Gallery, the Walker Art Center, and others.

His work in community development and social justice organizations has seen him act as a project manager, organizer, and educator. His work is held in private collections in the United States and Brazil.
