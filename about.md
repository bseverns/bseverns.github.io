# About / CV (legacy stub)

This route stayed live so the archive index could keep pointing somewhere real. If you need current context, jump over to the press kit—it carries the most up-to-date bio, pull quotes, and asset links.

If you were hunting for the old PDFs or deeper CV line items, email me and I’ll send a refreshed packet. Keeping it manual beats letting outdated copies spin out in the wild.
